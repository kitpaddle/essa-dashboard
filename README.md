Started a project to visualise information relevant to both pilots and ATC at ESSA Airport (Stockholm Arlanda).

I'm getting live data for SIGMETS and METAR and I've also managed to get live info for some of the swedish airports (alas not ESSA yet which is why I'm using a "placeholder" at the moment).

The info is updated quite often (every few minutes depending on the data). The data is updated automatically but can also be manually forced.

I also get the active NOTAMS valid for ESSA but at the moment do not do more with them.
Plan is to PARSE the NOTAMS and see if I can visualise closures (on TWYs, RWYs or airspace in CTR) graphically on the map.

Haven't updated it in a while as I'm focusing on other projects at the moment but could be fun to continue at some point.

ALL DATA AVAILABLE ON THE SITE IS ACCESSED THROUGH OPEN-SOURCE DATA.
